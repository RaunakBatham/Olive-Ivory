<h1 class="about"><center><b>History</b></center></h1>
   <b> <p class="main">Our jewel of the 20th century architecture is one of the most characteristic structures in Palava City.</p></b>

<p class="main">The Hotel Olive Ivory was built between<b> 2005 – 2008</b>, according to the design of the provincial architect. It was modelled after the Four Seasons Resort Bali in Indonesia, designed by Jaya Ibrahim, son of a Sumatran diplomat and Yogyanese princess.</p>

<p class="main">The building was erected in the square belonging to the queen Elizabeth, purchased by Jashan Singh and Raunak Batham. The eclectic building, situated in the Palava City, became its pride - and remains such to this day. The structure was majestic for the contemporary city, impressive thanks to its architecture and standard, and has always attracted guests with its modernity and level of comfort. In the old times, most guests came from the wealthy gentry circles. Even then, the building was already equipped with luxurious bathrooms, as well as its own restaurant and confectionary on the ground floor. The Olive Ivory complex also included: a glove manufacturer, an accessory shop, a perfumery, and an optic and physical workshop. </p>

<p class="main">In <b>2010</b>, pursuant to the will of the batham family, the ownership to the hotel was transferred to the Charity Association. On <b>26 December 2011</b>, the building was partially damaged by bombing.</p>

<p class="main">After the devastations of the <b>26/11 attack</b>, the facility was rebuilt, preserving its former look. After that, the Hotel Olive Ivory and Restaurant, now state-owned, enjoyed a great reputation. The famous lawyers of Mumbai, professors at University of Mumbai and the and Indian Institute of Technology of Mumbai, as well as priests and artists all had their favourite tables at the establishment. Rakesh Khanna , a popular actor of that time, was also one of the regulars. It was enough to order "a shot" to have the honour of a conversation with the master. In turn, a well-known Mumbai jeweller, PN Gadgil & Sons, entered the restaurants on his luxury car after a long drive to drink "one for the road" with the guests.</p>

<p class="main">In <b>2014</b>, under the supervision of the new manager, the building gained a brand new image and standard. The facade of the former building was one of the few features that remained unchanged. The furnishing and interior design were executed in a close cooperation with the conservation services.</p>

<p class="main">A few examples of the original elements of the building were renovated and integrated into the new design. The Hotel Olive Ivory is listed as an architecture monument and included in the Mumbai tourist route. Today, the Hotel Olive Ivory is one of the most recognisable hotels in the city with a unique history.</p>
