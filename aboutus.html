    <p>The four-star Hotel Olive Ivory is a jewel of the 20th century architecture, located in the strict centre of Palawa City, Mumbai. Because of our prestigious location, we have already been a perfect haven for 10 years both for people travelling as a tourist, as well as for business purposes .

    We have 72 comfortably equipped rooms, including two suites: The President Suite and the Ambassador Suite, with over one hundred metres of surface area, which are sure to awe even the most demanding Guests. We offer 7 rooms, where we have been preparing family and business meetings already for 15 years.

    The Hotel Olive Ivory is not merely the building but, above all, its people. We are a team of professionals, who can organise every event end-to-end.

    We have many years of experience, extensive conference facilities, as well as technical and catering equipment, and we will be more than happy to organise your meeting – both in our building, in a tent at the hotel's patio, as well as in any other place of your choosing.</p>
